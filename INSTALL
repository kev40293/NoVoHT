NoVoHT is built using autotools so to compile and install
simply run
./configure
make
make install

link other programs with -lnovoht in the LDFLAGS

NoVoHT is built using libtool for
compatibility so libtool must be installed.

Alternatively it can be compiled manually
in the src directory with
g++ -c -o novoht.o novoht.cxx
if its not necessary to be dynamically linked.
